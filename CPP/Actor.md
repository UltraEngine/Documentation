# Actor

In the entity component system, the actor is our main object type. The actor poseesses an entity as and additional modular "blocks" of behavior called [components](Component.md). An actor has only one entity but can have multiple components.

| Property | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| entity | const shared_ptr<[Entity](Entity.md)>& | entity this actor controls |
| [AddComponent](Actor_AddComponent.md) | Method | adds a new component to the actor |
| [Copy](Actor_Copy.md) | Method | makes a copy of the actor |
| [GetComponent](Actor_GetComponent.md) | Method | gets the component of the specified type, if it exists |
| [Start](Actor_Start.md) | Method | called once when the component is created |
| [CreateActor](CreateActor.md) | Function | creates a new actor |
| [GetEntityActor](GetEntityActor.md) | Function | retrieves an entity's actor |

Additional methods may be generated by the preprocessor. These attributes will be created based on the component classes that are present in your project source code files.
