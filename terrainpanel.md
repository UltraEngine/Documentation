# Terrain Panel

The Terrain Panel is a specialized interface that becomes accessible when using the terrain mouse tool ![](https://github.com/UltraEngine/Documentation/blob/master/Images/terraintool.png?raw=true) is in use. It provides a comprehensive set of tools and controls for working with terrains in your project.

Here's a detailed overview of its features and functionality:

## Terrain Editing Tools
The Terrain Panel offers a range of essential tools for editing and enhancing terrain landscapes. These tools include:

- **Sculpt Tool**: This tool enables you to manipulate the terrain by raising or lowering its elevation. It's a powerful feature for shaping the terrain to create hills, valleys, and other natural features.

- **Paint Tool**: The Paint Tool is used for applying material layers to the terrain. It allows you to select a material layer and paint it onto the terrain, defining the surface's visual characteristics. You can control the tool radius and strength using sliders to achieve precise results.

## Material Layer Management
In the Terrain Panel, you'll find a Material Layer List, which displays all the material layers currently in use on the terrain. Each material layer can be customized in the following ways:

- **Texture Mapping Scale**: You can adjust the texture mapping scale for each material layer. This control allows you to fine-tune the tiling and appearance of the materials applied to the terrain.

- **Height and Slope Constraints**: Material layers can be configured with optional height and slope constraints. These constraints define where and how the material layer can be painted onto the terrain. This level of control ensures that materials are applied only to specific areas of the landscape, based on the desired height and slope parameters.

The Terrain Panel serves as a central hub for terrain editing and material layer management, offering an efficient and user-friendly environment for creating stunning and realistic landscapes within your projects.
